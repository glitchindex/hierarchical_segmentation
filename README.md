#### LLM (Gemini Pro 2.5 Recommended) Prompt for Analyzing R Hierarchical/K-Proto Cluster Analyses:
#### Do not forget to fill in areas denoted by [ ] 

Hello!

I am providing a CSV file that contains comprehensive hierarchical and K-prototype cluster analyses. My goal is to [Describe your primary objective, e.g., "identify key audience segments to personalize our community features," or "understand user groups to improve our product features."]

Here is some key information about the data:
* **File:** [name the attached .csv file here]
* **The Goal:** [Reiterate your main goal in one sentence.]
* **Key Columns to Focus On:** [List any columns that are particularly important for defining the segments, e.g., 'income', 'adoption_rate', 'ltv'. If all are equally important, you can say "All columns are relevant for clustering."]
* **Column to Ignore:** [List any columns that should be excluded from the analysis, like 'id', 'customer_name', or other unique identifiers.]
* **Business Context:** [Provide a brief description of your community. For example: "We are a B2C subscription box service for wellness products," or "We are a mobile gaming app targeting casual players."]

For the output, please provide:
1.  A descriptive persona and name for each identified cluster (e.g., "Tech-Savvy Early Adopters").
2.  A bullet-point summary of the key characteristics of each group.
3.  A specific, actionable marketing or business strategy tailored to each group.
4.  The estimated LTV and CAC for each group
5.  A beachhead acquisition strategy: A recommended order for acquiring the groups based on the "beachhead" concept to maximize influence and lower acquisition costs.
6.  Actionable Group-Specific Strategies: A specific marketing or business strategy tailored to each individual group.
7.  Compare and contrast key differences between the hierarchical clustering and K-prototypes grouping results.

Thank you!
